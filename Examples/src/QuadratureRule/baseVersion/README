Basic classes and function for numerical integration

They depend on the library libMesh1D, and on GetPot so you have first
to go to src/Utilities and then to src/OneDMesh, look at the readme
files and compile typping in each directory

makedistclean;make dynamic DEBUG=no; make install; make distclean

============ QUADRULES

To compile with dynamic libaries make dynamic

to compile with static libraries

make static (It may not work)

library binding is local unless DEBUG=no is indicated

to install libraries and headers in the directories lib eand include
under the Example directory (where we put headers and libraries of the
course) do

make distclean
make dynamic DEBUG=no
make static DEBUG=no
make install

===

make exec DEBUG=no LIBTYPE=STATIC/DYNAMIC

compiles the exec without recompiling the libraries and do not use
local (i.e.  current directory) linking but used the directories in
Examples/lib. use static/dynamic if you want static or dynamic linking.

Remeber to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The rule run_quadrul.sh contains a
script to run the test program.
