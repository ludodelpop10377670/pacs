Classes to handle a simple mesh

You need first to compile and install RK45:

go to Examples/src/RK45 and do

make distclean
make dynamic DEBUG=no  (to disable debugging)
make install
make distclean

Include files go to the Examples/include and the library librk45.so in Examples/lib.

Go back to this directory and run make distclean; make dynamic (or static)

Make sure to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly. In 

runTestGenerator.sh you have an example of how to launch the example to test the code

IF YOU WANT TO INSTAL THE CODE (needed for other examples) do

make distclean
make dynamic DEBUG=no  (to disable debugging)
make install
make distclean
